                    It wasn’t until an extremely hot day in August of 2008 when Dales was visiting Durban with their other mutual friend, Gordon, that the first true introduction was made.  For those of you who haven’t seen Durban beach on a hot August day, it can get extremely crowded to the point where you can’t even find a place to sit.  Gordon decided that he would call his friend Matildah to see if they could use her pool and she agreed. 
                <p>She totally remembers the exact moment Dales walked into her apartment with Gordon. the pool. Dales had already decided he was moving to Gauteng so she didn't think too long about him.</p>

About a month later, however, Dales and Matildah’s paths realigned when they ran into each other at the bar, Landmark, at Polokwane.  Matildah turned to her friend Rose and asked, “Isn’t that Dales Kraus? Didn’t he move to Gauteng? Is he single?”  Rose answered, “Yes, No, and Yes.”  That night, December 13th 2008, is the night that Dales and Matildah describe as their anniversary.<br/>
                <p>

                    The reason Matildah feels their relationship was crafted by fate is if they met any other time in the few years before the day at the pool, they don’t know if it would have all worked out.  It is all about being at the right place at the right time, and when they met it was the right time in their lives. </p>
