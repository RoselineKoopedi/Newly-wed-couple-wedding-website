                We couldn't be more excited to not only marry each other, but to also bring our families together.<br/> 
                Our parents are our role models, our mentors, and most importantly, they are our friends.<br/> 
                They have shaped us into the adults we are today and exemplify what it takes to be a loyal and loving partner.<br/> 
                Our sisters, Melissa and Lauren, our brother-in-law, Jeff, and our nephew, Spencer, will each play an important role in the wedding and we are honored to have each one of them standing by our side.<br/> 
                We love our familes so much and we can't thank them enough for all that they do everyday, and everything they are doing to make this wedding our dream come true.
